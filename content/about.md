# Hi! I'm Francesca

When my husband and I made the decision several years ago to start trying to have children I don't think anything could have really prepared us for the adventure we were about to embark on.  We had our son, Miles, in 2015 and dealt with the typical new parent "stuff": late nights, lots of diapers, work/parenting balance, Terrible Twos, even more Terrible Threes...but none of this prepared us for what was about to happen when our daughter was born in 2018.

When Vera was born we received the shock of our lives: she was born with Down Syndrome.  To many people, this might seem like bad news, but to us it was just the start of an amazing journey into the world of Special Needs Parenting.

Follow me as I tell you stories and experiences of parenting in the trenches!


Just a little bit about me...

I'm a full-time elementary school teacher, married to Ben, a full-time systems engineer (don't ask me what that means)  We have a hilarious 5 year-old son and an equally-as-funny daughter.  We also have a 120-pound Bernese Mountain Dognamed Dexter.
