    "body": "As we come to the end of October, which is Down Syndrome Awareness Month, I’m often reminded of one of the most important parts of our parenting journey: our village. As I scrolled through social media this month I saw post after post of really inspiring messages from other families that are on the Down Syndrome adventure just as we are. While reading these beautiful posts I was reminded of something very important: I’m not alone.\nI remember sitting in the pediatrician’s office as she told us the results of Vera’s blood tests at birth. There were probably a million thoughts buzzing through my head as she told us the diagnosis. Going home that day, I remember feeling very isolated. I knew we always had our friends and family to offer us support, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were suddenly going to become the family that “can’t do anything” anymore. I feel like there is such a stigma that follows parents of children with special needs: like their children are just going to be too much trouble for them to even have time to live their lives normally. Would we become part of that stereotype? We quickly began to realize that we would not.\nFinding Our Community As soon as we told our loved ones about Vera’s official diagnosis we were immediately met with tons of support. We had family and friends sending us articles about amazing people with Down Syndrome, telling us about people they know with Down Syndrome, and most importantly just spending time getting to know Vera. The love we felt was overwhelming. Two years into the journey and those same family and friends are always staying up-to-date with Vera’s accomplishments, always offering support, and still sharing all of the wonderful stories they have of others with Down Syndrome.\nWithin a few weeks of Vera’s birth, we were referred to a school called Stepping Stones. It is a school for children with Down Syndrome that starts with Early Intervention services. The school goes up to age 10. I was so anxious to get Vera started there because I so desperately wanted to meet other families that also had young ones with Down Syndrome. Boy, did we get lucky! Within the first few sessions there, we made friends with an amazing family who we are still friendly with today. From there, those connections grew into joining Facebook groups and following other families’ Instagram pages. Social media has a lot of negatives, but this is one of the few positives that it provides!\nMaking the Right Connections Just within the last year, we’ve connected with so many more families that are on the same adventure as us. I’ve found other people that I can ask questions to. I’ve found other people who I can relate stories to. I’ve found other people who know the many struggles that we’ve been dealing with. What makes me feel even more fortunate is that the love and support that we get doesn’t just come from the other Down Syndrome families. Our friends and family that we’ve known for most of our lives have been so involved in Vera’s development. You have no idea what a difference this makes as a special needs parent!\nTrue support comes from the people who are there for you not just for the celebrations, but when things get rocky. There have been more times than I can even count when I’ve cried, become frustrated, and wanted to give up on so many parenting moments. Trying to conduct therapy sessions with a toddler during a pandemic is nothing short of impossible, but the encouragement that we constantly receive from the people we love is what keeps us moving. It’s what keeps Vera moving.\nVery recently, our pediatrician reached out to me and said she has a new patient with Down Syndrome. She wanted to know if she could forward them my number so they could call with any questions or even just to talk. I was beyond thrilled! I remember my first phone conversation with that mom lasted a few hours. I haven’t spoken on the phone that long since I was a teenager! We just had so much to talk about. There were so many stories to share and encouraging words to give her. We are thankfully still in touch, and she even brings her son to Stepping Stones. It is connections like these that make the journey all the more rewarding.\nI know it sounds cliche to say “it takes a village” but I truly, truly believe in this statement with every fiber of my being. There is no possible way that Ben and I would be able to raise our kids and help Vera meet her milestones without the people around us. Her therapists, our family, our friends, our new-found Down Syndrome family: they all are what keep us moving when things get tough. As we close out Down Syndrome Awareness Month I want to thank all of you and I also want to remind other special needs parents out there that you are not alone. We see you, we love you. You got this.\n",

    "body": "It has taken a long time for me to finally sit in front of my computer and actually start typing for this next post. I feel like over the last several months I’ve spent so much time in front of the computer screen that my brain just couldn’t handle it anymore. Lately, I’ve had a lot of extra time to think about the situation of things this year (being home 24/7 does that to you). I’ve been home since March, teaching remotely while my husband also works remotely. At the same time, we have our son in a hybrid schooling program and we have Vera’s therapy (four sessions a week!) It has been so easy to fall into the pity-party trap. Honestly, I’ve succumbed to a personal pity-party about 6,000 times since the pandemic started in March. Honestly, who hasn’t? I cannot think of one person who has not, at one point or another, thought to themselves, “This is the worst year ever.”\nThe Ultimate Pity-Party When Vera was born I remember exactly how the two of us felt when we heard of her diagnosis. I remember Ben telling me, “You have no idea how hard our lives are about to get.” I remember believing that and crying thinking that we’ll never have an easy time as special-needs parents. Don’t we all go through that, though, when we receive news like this? Find me a special-needs parent who has NOT thought this exact same thing. I bet you can’t. It’s human nature to receive life-changing news and immediately think, “Why me?” I spent weeks feeling sorry for myself. Obviously we know how the story ends: Vera ends up being the perfect little baby that we all needed. I would not change a thing about her. But I would be lying if I said that initially I didn’t feel that way. I felt badly for myself. So many specialist appointments, so many initial medical concerns, so many therapy evaluations: why was this happening? Why couldn’t have the motherhood experience that everyone around me was having?\nI truly believe that everyone deserves the space to grieve the life they initially saw for themselves. We all go into parenthood with this vision of what we want and expect. For some people, that vision comes true. For others, it doesn’t. When it doesn’t, go ahead and throw yourself the pity-party. Grieve the loss of that vision. Feel badly for this overwhelming change you’re about to go through. These feelings won’t last forever. They probably won’t even last a whole month. Be kind to yourself as you adapt to this new normal.\nNew normal: that’s a phrase I think we’re all tired of hearing, am I right? 2020 seemed so hopeful for all of us. Now here we are\u0026hellip;in our houses going on nine straight months. No parties, no school, no playdates, no Girls’ Night Out, no football with the guys. We stay in our houses and if we do decide to leave, we make sure we bring that little piece of cloth that has now become another appendage. This is what our “new normal” is. As we’ve battled the challenges of this year, I often think back to Vera’s birth: to when I sat in that hospital bed feeling nothing but sorry for myself. If only someone had just slapped me and told me to snap out of it (where is Cher when you need her?) If only I had known what a truly amazing addition to my life Vera was going to be. If only I had known that in two years we were about to face some REAL challenges.\nSpreading Gratefulness Over the last few months I’ve had a lot of time to think about our personal situations in our house. Things have been hard, I’m not going to sugar coat it. Recently, however, Ben and I had a conversation about privilege. We complain about being stuck at home working\u0026hellip;but we both have jobs that provide us with a comfortable income. We complain about having to sit with our kids for remote learning\u0026hellip;but there are so many people right now that can’t do that with their own kids. We complain about the amount of work we have around the house\u0026hellip;but we have a house. I know this sounds self-righteous. I don’t mean for it to sound that way. I just have been working really hard lately to put things into perspective. We are privileged. There’s no other way of saying it. We can embrace it, but also recognize that there are people who do not have this same privilege. We can’t forget those people. The lessons I learn from all of this I hope to pass on to my own kids: to understand that not everyone has it the way we have it and we need to recognize that and find ways of using our privilege for good.\nThis year involved so many people getting sick, so many people dealing with significant loss. It’s so hard for us all to not just fall into the Pit of Despair. I keep trying to tell myself, “2021 just HAS to be better.” Maybe it will\u0026hellip;maybe it won’t. But if I have taken anything away from this dumpster fire of a year, it’s that I have a new sense of gratitude. I’m grateful that my family has a home to quarantine in. I’m grateful that I have people who have been so willing to help us with childcare so we can work full-time. I’m grateful that I have two kids who have proven that they can overcome difficult situations. I can go on and on.\nBy saying all of this, do I think that people shouldn’t feel sorry for themselves? No. Do I think that we don’t deserve the time and space to feel badly about our situations? Also, no. If you take anything away from this, I hope it’s that you learn how to be kind to yourself. We’re all going through some tough stuff right now. Yes, some people have it worse, but that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve your time to manage your struggles.\n2020 sucked, for lack of a better word. Let’s go into 2021 with a new sense of gratitude for what we do have. Let’s go into 2021 practicing kindness, not only to others, but to ourselves. Wishing you all a New Year filled with far better luck than we had in 2020.\n",

    "body": "I remember the day my son Miles was born. It was in May. I had just spent the last 15 hours in labor. Long story short, it was a complicated birth. It was almost the universe’s way of telling us that we were in for a real adventure with our son. Since the day he was born, Miles has had a very bold personality! Ben and I always knew it just wouldn’t be fair to keep him an only child. He needed a sibling to entertain, and pronto!\nWhen I was pregnant with Vera, Miles was going through a very big “planets” phase. He LOVED reading about planets, singing songs about planets, memorizing facts about planets. It became such a huge part of his life that he kept insisting that we name his baby sister Neptune. Anytime he referred to the baby, he referred to her as Neptune. When it was time for me to go to the hospital, all he could think of was meeting Neptune. We introduced him to his sister and called her Vera, his first response was, “But I thought her name was Neptune!”. Sorry, kid!\nThe Big Introduction I so vividly remember the first time Miles met Vera. It was a few hours after she was born and I was holding her in our hospital room. Miles walked in, very quietly (which is highly unusual for him), and snuggled up next to me in bed. We handed Vera over to him and for the first time in his three years of life, he just sat silently. He studied her. He smiled at her. After his moment with her was done, he asked to hand her back to me, and off he went, back to being the spunky and loud kid that he is.\nIt’s so hard to talk to a child when they’re only three-years-old about differences in people. Most kids see things in the concrete, literal sense. To try and explain how Vera was different just seemed like a challenge we weren’t really ready to face. We also didn’t have very much time to prepare for the conversation. Vera was born and within a month we were sprung into a whirlwind of specialist appointments, pediatrician appointments, therapy appointments, and evaluations. Where in there did we even have time to talk to our oldest about what was going on? Is he thinking this is just how every baby gets treated? Did he think that this is what his infancy must have been like?\nWhen you have a younger child with special needs and an older child that is neuro-typical, I think the best thing you can do is search for books that are geared toward the right age-level. For us, the book was We’ll Paint the Octopus Red by Stephanie Sluve-Bodeen. Our cousin got the book for us a few months after Vera was born and I remember thinking, “Oh wow, I didn’t even think of getting storybooks about this to read to Miles.” I blame it on the fact that I was still processing being a special-needs parent. When I did eventually get around to reading the book to Miles, I remember I started to cry. The book so beautifully explained the sibling bond and it gave me so much hope for what Miles’ and Vera’s relationship will be as they both get older.\nThere are definitely a lot of challenges that come with having a child with Down Syndrome. One of those challenges is how you budget your time equally between your children. Vera needs a lot of our attention. She has therapy four times a week (since she was only a few months old) and she is also a two-year old. Two year-olds require a lot of attention to begin with. Add on all of the extras and it can be overwhelming. I think the biggest challenge in all of that is trying to make sure Miles still gets his fair share of attention. One of my big fears is having him grow up thinking he wasn’t loved as much or he wasn’t given the same amount of attention as his sister. It can be heartbreaking sometimes when he is trying to talk to us and we have to cut him off to handle something with Vera.\nSome Pointers… We’ve spent a lot of the last two years figuring out ways to make sure Miles knows his value and importance within our household. If you’re a special-needs parent who is struggling with the sibling balance, here are a few pointers from a mom who is currently right there with you.\n  Books: Reading storybooks has been super helpful in getting Miles to understand the differences his sister has. Look for books that focus on the specific diagnosis of your child, but also consider books that just talk about how we manage and accept all people from all walks of life.\n  Therapy: Have your older child join in on their sibling’s therapy sessions. It’s a great way for them to feel their importance. They’ll learn how they can help and it’s good for their self-esteem!\n  Alone time: It’s so important to give your older child some “Mom and Me” or “Dad and Me” time. Miles loves when we get to have a movie date together, or send Vera to Grandma’s and take him for a special day on his own.\n  Set the Bar High: Set equal expectations for both of your children. Obviously, there are times when a special-needs child needs more attention, more care, etc. However, depending on your child’s diagnosis, managing and setting up mostly equal expectations for both of your kids allows your children to develop together. The way you teach and manage those expectations should be modified for each of your children, but the end goal should be the same.\n  Milestones: Let your older child be a big part of the milestones. We are currently trying to get Vera to walk by herself. Miles has been a great motivator for her. He stands nearby ready to catch her if she falls and gets to celebrate her big moment when she does take her steps!\n  I’m so grateful for the relationship our two kids have with each other. We were very nervous during Vera’s early months that we were going to see a regression of behavior in our son, but we’ve been relieved to see how much they’ve developed together. Miles tells his sister every day how much he loves her. He has become her protector and her biggest supporter. In return, he has become Vera’s absolute favorite person. As their mom, I couldn’t be prouder!\n",

    "body": "I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to be a mom. I was the first-born in a family of three and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve always fit into that stereotypical \u0026ldquo;first-born\u0026rdquo; mold. I always liked to be in-charge, set the rules, and have a certain amount of control of what was around me. Boy did that change when I became a mom! My son, Miles, was born in 2015 on Star Wars Day (if you knew how much my husband is into \u0026ldquo;Nerd Culture\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;d understand what a big deal this is). Just as his mother did, Miles immediately fit the \u0026ldquo;first-born\u0026rdquo; mold. He was a rule-follower from the very beginning: no baby-proofing needed with him! He began talking before he turned one and took his first steps on his first birthday. By all accounts, Miles was the typical first-born boy: cautious, sensitive, stubborn, and he absorbed things like a sponge (he still does)! As tough as years two and three were with Miles, my husband and I still felt like we were nailing this parenting game. We kept our kid alive and happy, and for the most part we seemed to manage the working-parent lifestyle.\nAnd then the Summer of 2017 happened\u0026hellip; We learned we were having baby number two! This was an exciting moment for us. Our energetic boy was going to become a big brother and our family dynamic was about to change. This time around, we told our parents almost right away about the good news. I began looking at baby names and designing a nursery in my mind. What could go wrong?\nLong story short, that August I miscarried. It was quite a blow to our systems. We had such a smooth-sailing experience the first time around. It took several months to move past the heartbreak (a blog post for another day). Finally, on Christmas Eve that very same year, we found out we were having another baby. Christmas Eve was my grandmother, Margaret\u0026rsquo;s, birthday. It was a day that always held importance to me. I felt like this was the first subtle sign that were in for quite an adventure with this new baby.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s Here! Vera Margaret was born on a hot Wednesday on August 29, 2018. She came a week earlier than her due date. She came into the world without too much fuss. Clearly she was just tired of being on the inside and needed to make her grand entrance. I had dealt with a lot of anxiety during my pregnancy with Vera (yet another blog post for another day). When she was held up over the curtain for me to see I was just so thrilled that she was alive and here. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to just hold her and feel that sense of calm that I had been waiting for. My husband, Ben, on the other hand, had a very different reaction when the doctors held Vera up for that first time. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what specifically clued him in that something unexpected had happened: maybe it was her tongue that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep in her mouth, the extra thickness in the back of her neck, or the uniqueness in her beautiful baby eyes. Whatever it was, Ben\u0026rsquo;s very first thought when Vera was held up was, \u0026ldquo;Oh my God\u0026hellip;our baby has Down Syndrome.\u0026rdquo;\nVera was taken out of the operating room for the usual rounds of tests and monitoring before heading to the recovery area with Mama. Ben went with her, the entire time thinking, \u0026ldquo;When is someone going to tell us the news? Am I going crazy?\u0026rdquo; Apparently there are many different types of protocols in situations like this and no one is allowed to suggest any sort of concern without an examination from a pediatrician first. So, patiently, Ben had to wait until the next morning for the doctor to confirm with him what he already knew, all the while mom and baby are snuggling and attempting nursing, so blindly unaware of what was about to rock our worlds.\nThe Diagnosis Our pediatrician visited the hospital the next morning and did her routine examinations of Vera. Shortly after, she came to our room and sat at the edge of my bed. I was sitting in a chair across from the bed, just glad I was able to move around post-surgery. The doctor took a deep breath and said, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so here are some things I observed with Vera.\u0026rdquo; She started with the positives: she seems healthy overall and she was impressed with how chill this baby is (we were equally as impressed considering our first-born had and still has zero-chill). Then, she said it: \u0026ldquo;Vera is showing some physical attributes of Down Syndrome and I\u0026rsquo;m going to order blood work to test her for it.\u0026rdquo; In that moment, the room fell silent. Ben held his head low, nodding in a way that says, \u0026ldquo;I knew it\u0026rdquo;. In most situations, a new mom would most likely begin crying, but in that moment the only words I could muster up were, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so\u0026hellip;what do we do about that?\u0026rdquo;\nI should mention before continuing that we have the BEST pediatrician in the world. I mean, the absolute best. She calmly explained to us what the next steps were and how to get the ball rolling on finding the right specialists to take Vera to. The entire time she remained calm, positive, and assuring. I think it was her demeanor that prevented me from absolutely breaking down. In fact, when I think back to that day I don\u0026rsquo;t think I cried at all. I think there was just so much to process that my \u0026ldquo;first-born\u0026rdquo; instincts kicked in and I just needed to figure out how to get control of the situation and do what needed to be done for Vera.\nIt should be said that my husband is an entirely different person than I am in most situations. While I usually panic and become riddled with anxiety, he is the person who remains calm and collected, being able to put out fires better than most people I know. In this particular moment, however, it became clear that Ben had never really been dealt a deck like this and all of the ways he usually knew how to cope flew very quickly out the window. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we talked for the next 24 hours. He put his headphones on to watch videos on his phone, I sat with a lactation consultant for hours on end trying to get Vera to latch. Our parents visited briefly. Finally, my husband decided to go home for a night to stay with Miles, while my mom stayed with me at the hospital. When Ben got home the panic set in. The tears formed. The frantic texts came saying, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll never be empty-nesters. We\u0026rsquo;ll never get to travel. We\u0026rsquo;ll never have our own lives. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to quit your job to provide constant care.\u0026rdquo; This, of course, put me into a panic. I spent the remainder of my evening on Google researching everything I could about Down Syndrome.\nAfter the official return home from the hospital, we spoke with our pediatrician and she assured us that we\u0026rsquo;d be able to live happy, fulfilling lives with Vera. At that moment, it was slightly hard to believe. About three weeks after she was born, we returned to the pediatrician\u0026rsquo;s office for a check-up. The doctor walked in and immediately placed a box of tissues in front of me. My initial thought was, \u0026ldquo;Oh no. The blood work came back and Vera has some sort of deadly illness.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s just me\u0026hellip;always jumping to the worst-case scenario. The doctor took a breath and said, \u0026ldquo;The blood results came back. Vera has Down Syndrome.\u0026rdquo; I had kept thinking that when we receive the official diagnosis I would break down and sob. Strangely, I felt a sense of calm. Almost a sense of relief. We had just spent the last three weeks researching and talking to people about how to prepare for this diagnosis, and now it\u0026rsquo;s here and I\u0026rsquo;m just grateful we have answers. So now what?\nThe Rest of our Lives Ben and I dive-in head first to the world of special needs parenting. We learned real quick how overwhelming this experience would be. Within the first three months of her life we had seen a cardiologist, eye doctor, geneticist, physical therapist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, and enrolled her into an Early Intervention program at a local school for children with Down Syndrome. It was a whirlwind of evaluations, meetings, more evaluations, and doctors appointments. We thought this would dictate the rest of our lives.\nBy the time Vera had turned six months a revelation had happened within our household. Even with all of the appointments and therapy, and even with trying to balance raising two kids, we realized something important. Vera was put into our lives for a reason. The joy that she brings us is something I could never trade. If given the option to go back and change her diagnosis, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t. Vera is exactly who she is supposed to be. And our family is designed exactly the way it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be. Vera doesn\u0026rsquo;t just need us. As it turns out, we really need Vera.\n",
