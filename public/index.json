    "body": "I remember the day my son Miles was born. It was in May. I had just spent the last 15 hours in labor. Long story short, it was a complicated birth. It was almost the universe’s way of telling us that we were in for a real adventure with our son. Since the day he was born, Miles has had a very bold personality! Ben and I always knew it just wouldn’t be fair to keep him an only child. He needed a sibling to entertain, and pronto!\nWhen I was pregnant with Vera, Miles was going through a very big “planets” phase. He LOVED reading about planets, singing songs about planets, memorizing facts about planets. It became such a huge part of his life that he kept insisting that we name his baby sister Neptune. Anytime he referred to the baby, he referred to her as Neptune. When it was time for me to go to the hospital, all he could think of was meeting Neptune. We introduced him to his sister and called her Vera, his first response was, “But I thought her name was Neptune!”. Sorry, kid!\nThe Big Introduction I so vividly remember the first time Miles met Vera. It was a few hours after she was born and I was holding her in our hospital room. Miles walked in, very quietly (which is highly unusual for him), and snuggled up next to me in bed. We handed Vera over to him and for the first time in his three years of life, he just sat silently. He studied her. He smiled at her. After his moment with her was done, he asked to hand her back to me, and off he went, back to being the spunky and loud kid that he is.\nIt’s so hard to talk to a child when they’re only three-years-old about differences in people. Most kids see things in the concrete, literal sense. To try and explain how Vera was different just seemed like a challenge we weren’t really ready to face. We also didn’t have very much time to prepare for the conversation. Vera was born and within a month we were sprung into a whirlwind of specialist appointments, pediatrician appointments, therapy appointments, and evaluations. Where in there did we even have time to talk to our oldest about what was going on? Is he thinking this is just how every baby gets treated? Did he think that this is what his infancy must have been like?\nWhen you have a younger child with special needs and an older child that is neuro-typical, I think the best thing you can do is search for books that are geared toward the right age-level. For us, the book was We’ll Paint the Octopus Red by Stephanie Sluve-Bodeen. Our cousin got the book for us a few months after Vera was born and I remember thinking, “Oh wow, I didn’t even think of getting storybooks about this to read to Miles.” I blame it on the fact that I was still processing being a special-needs parent. When I did eventually get around to reading the book to Miles, I remember I started to cry. The book so beautifully explained the sibling bond and it gave me so much hope for what Miles’ and Vera’s relationship will be as they both get older.\nThere are definitely a lot of challenges that come with having a child with Down Syndrome. One of those challenges is how you budget your time equally between your children. Vera needs a lot of our attention. She has therapy four times a week (since she was only a few months old) and she is also a two-year old. Two year-olds require a lot of attention to begin with. Add on all of the extras and it can be overwhelming. I think the biggest challenge in all of that is trying to make sure Miles still gets his fair share of attention. One of my big fears is having him grow up thinking he wasn’t loved as much or he wasn’t given the same amount of attention as his sister. It can be heartbreaking sometimes when he is trying to talk to us and we have to cut him off to handle something with Vera.\nSome Pointers… We’ve spent a lot of the last two years figuring out ways to make sure Miles knows his value and importance within our household. If you’re a special-needs parent who is struggling with the sibling balance, here are a few pointers from a mom who is currently right there with you.\n  Books: Reading storybooks has been super helpful in getting Miles to understand the differences his sister has. Look for books that focus on the specific diagnosis of your child, but also consider books that just talk about how we manage and accept all people from all walks of life.\n  Therapy: Have your older child join in on their sibling’s therapy sessions. It’s a great way for them to feel their importance. They’ll learn how they can help and it’s good for their self-esteem!\n  Alone time: It’s so important to give your older child some “Mom and Me” or “Dad and Me” time. Miles loves when we get to have a movie date together, or send Vera to Grandma’s and take him for a special day on his own.\n  Set the Bar High: Set equal expectations for both of your children. Obviously, there are times when a special-needs child needs more attention, more care, etc. However, depending on your child’s diagnosis, managing and setting up mostly equal expectations for both of your kids allows your children to develop together. The way you teach and manage those expectations should be modified for each of your children, but the end goal should be the same.\n  Milestones: Let your older child be a big part of the milestones. We are currently trying to get Vera to walk by herself. Miles has been a great motivator for her. He stands nearby ready to catch her if she falls and gets to celebrate her big moment when she does take her steps!\n  I’m so grateful for the relationship our two kids have with each other. We were very nervous during Vera’s early months that we were going to see a regression of behavior in our son, but we’ve been relieved to see how much they’ve developed together. Miles tells his sister every day how much he loves her. He has become her protector and her biggest supporter. In return, he has become Vera’s absolute favorite person. As their mom, I couldn’t be prouder!\n",

    "body": "I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to be a mom. I was the first-born in a family of three and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve always fit into that stereotypical \u0026ldquo;first-born\u0026rdquo; mold. I always liked to be in-charge, set the rules, and have a certain amount of control of what was around me. Boy did that change when I became a mom! My son, Miles, was born in 2015 on Star Wars Day (if you knew how much my husband is into \u0026ldquo;Nerd Culture\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;d understand what a big deal this is). Just as his mother did, Miles immediately fit the \u0026ldquo;first-born\u0026rdquo; mold. He was a rule-follower from the very beginning: no baby-proofing needed with him! He began talking before he turned one and took his first steps on his first birthday. By all accounts, Miles was the typical first-born boy: cautious, sensitive, stubborn, and he absorbed things like a sponge (he still does)! As tough as years two and three were with Miles, my husband and I still felt like we were nailing this parenting game. We kept our kid alive and happy, and for the most part we seemed to manage the working-parent lifestyle.\nAnd then the Summer of 2017 happened\u0026hellip; We learned we were having baby number two! This was an exciting moment for us. Our energetic boy was going to become a big brother and our family dynamic was about to change. This time around, we told our parents almost right away about the good news. I began looking at baby names and designing a nursery in my mind. What could go wrong?\nLong story short, that August I miscarried. It was quite a blow to our systems. We had such a smooth-sailing experience the first time around. It took several months to move past the heartbreak (a blog post for another day). Finally, on Christmas Eve that very same year, we found out we were having another baby. Christmas Eve was my grandmother, Margaret\u0026rsquo;s, birthday. It was a day that always held importance to me. I felt like this was the first subtle sign that were in for quite an adventure with this new baby.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s Here! Vera Margaret was born on a hot Wednesday on August 29, 2018. She came a week earlier than her due date. She came into the world without too much fuss. Clearly she was just tired of being on the inside and needed to make her grand entrance. I had dealt with a lot of anxiety during my pregnancy with Vera (yet another blog post for another day). When she was held up over the curtain for me to see I was just so thrilled that she was alive and here. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to just hold her and feel that sense of calm that I had been waiting for. My husband, Ben, on the other hand, had a very different reaction when the doctors held Vera up for that first time. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what specifically clued him in that something unexpected had happened: maybe it was her tongue that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep in her mouth, the extra thickness in the back of her neck, or the uniqueness in her beautiful baby eyes. Whatever it was, Ben\u0026rsquo;s very first thought when Vera was held up was, \u0026ldquo;Oh my God\u0026hellip;our baby has Down Syndrome.\u0026rdquo;\nVera was taken out of the operating room for the usual rounds of tests and monitoring before heading to the recovery area with Mama. Ben went with her, the entire time thinking, \u0026ldquo;When is someone going to tell us the news? Am I going crazy?\u0026rdquo; Apparently there are many different types of protocols in situations like this and no one is allowed to suggest any sort of concern without an examination from a pediatrician first. So, patiently, Ben had to wait until the next morning for the doctor to confirm with him what he already knew, all the while mom and baby are snuggling and attempting nursing, so blindly unaware of what was about to rock our worlds.\nThe Diagnosis Our pediatrician visited the hospital the next morning and did her routine examinations of Vera. Shortly after, she came to our room and sat at the edge of my bed. I was sitting in a chair across from the bed, just glad I was able to move around post-surgery. The doctor took a deep breath and said, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so here are some things I observed with Vera.\u0026rdquo; She started with the positives: she seems healthy overall and she was impressed with how chill this baby is (we were equally as impressed considering our first-born had and still has zero-chill). Then, she said it: \u0026ldquo;Vera is showing some physical attributes of Down Syndrome and I\u0026rsquo;m going to order blood work to test her for it.\u0026rdquo; In that moment, the room fell silent. Ben held his head low, nodding in a way that says, \u0026ldquo;I knew it\u0026rdquo;. In most situations, a new mom would most likely begin crying, but in that moment the only words I could muster up were, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so\u0026hellip;what do we do about that?\u0026rdquo;\nI should mention before continuing that we have the BEST pediatrician in the world. I mean, the absolute best. She calmly explained to us what the next steps were and how to get the ball rolling on finding the right specialists to take Vera to. The entire time she remained calm, positive, and assuring. I think it was her demeanor that prevented me from absolutely breaking down. In fact, when I think back to that day I don\u0026rsquo;t think I cried at all. I think there was just so much to process that my \u0026ldquo;first-born\u0026rdquo; instincts kicked in and I just needed to figure out how to get control of the situation and do what needed to be done for Vera.\nIt should be said that my husband is an entirely different person than I am in most situations. While I usually panic and become riddled with anxiety, he is the person who remains calm and collected, being able to put out fires better than most people I know. In this particular moment, however, it became clear that Ben had never really been dealt a deck like this and all of the ways he usually knew how to cope flew very quickly out the window. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we talked for the next 24 hours. He put his headphones on to watch videos on his phone, I sat with a lactation consultant for hours on end trying to get Vera to latch. Our parents visited briefly. Finally, my husband decided to go home for a night to stay with Miles, while my mom stayed with me at the hospital. When Ben got home the panic set in. The tears formed. The frantic texts came saying, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll never be empty-nesters. We\u0026rsquo;ll never get to travel. We\u0026rsquo;ll never have our own lives. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to quit your job to provide constant care.\u0026rdquo; This, of course, put me into a panic. I spent the remainder of my evening on Google researching everything I could about Down Syndrome.\nAfter the official return home from the hospital, we spoke with our pediatrician and she assured us that we\u0026rsquo;d be able to live happy, fulfilling lives with Vera. At that moment, it was slightly hard to believe. About three weeks after she was born, we returned to the pediatrician\u0026rsquo;s office for a check-up. The doctor walked in and immediately placed a box of tissues in front of me. My initial thought was, \u0026ldquo;Oh no. The blood work came back and Vera has some sort of deadly illness.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s just me\u0026hellip;always jumping to the worst-case scenario. The doctor took a breath and said, \u0026ldquo;The blood results came back. Vera has Down Syndrome.\u0026rdquo; I had kept thinking that when we receive the official diagnosis I would break down and sob. Strangely, I felt a sense of calm. Almost a sense of relief. We had just spent the last three weeks researching and talking to people about how to prepare for this diagnosis, and now it\u0026rsquo;s here and I\u0026rsquo;m just grateful we have answers. So now what?\nThe Rest of our Lives Ben and I dive-in head first to the world of special needs parenting. We learned real quick how overwhelming this experience would be. Within the first three months of her life we had seen a cardiologist, eye doctor, geneticist, physical therapist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, and enrolled her into an Early Intervention program at a local school for children with Down Syndrome. It was a whirlwind of evaluations, meetings, more evaluations, and doctors appointments. We thought this would dictate the rest of our lives.\nBy the time Vera had turned six months a revelation had happened within our household. Even with all of the appointments and therapy, and even with trying to balance raising two kids, we realized something important. Vera was put into our lives for a reason. The joy that she brings us is something I could never trade. If given the option to go back and change her diagnosis, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t. Vera is exactly who she is supposed to be. And our family is designed exactly the way it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be. Vera doesn\u0026rsquo;t just need us. As it turns out, we really need Vera.\n",
