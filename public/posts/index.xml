      <description>A Quiet Battle During the last year it has been very obvious that our country as a whole has been having a tough time. Covid-19 hit us very rapidly and within days our world was changed. Often, I think about the typical battles we fight in our everyday lives: parenting challenges, work challenges, relationship challenges, emotional challenges. Now, we’re all forced to manage those challenges in the middle of a pandemic.</description>

      <description>It has taken a long time for me to finally sit in front of my computer and actually start typing for this next post. I feel like over the last several months I’ve spent so much time in front of the computer screen that my brain just couldn’t handle it anymore. Lately, I’ve had a lot of extra time to think about the situation of things this year (being home 24/7 does that to you).</description>

      <description>As we come to the end of October, which is Down Syndrome Awareness Month, I’m often reminded of one of the most important parts of our parenting journey: our village. As I scrolled through social media this month I saw post after post of really inspiring messages from other families that are on the Down Syndrome adventure just as we are. While reading these beautiful posts I was reminded of something very important: I’m not alone.</description>

      <description>I remember the day my son Miles was born. It was in May. I had just spent the last 15 hours in labor. Long story short, it was a complicated birth. It was almost the universe’s way of telling us that we were in for a real adventure with our son. Since the day he was born, Miles has had a very bold personality! Ben and I always knew it just wouldn’t be fair to keep him an only child.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to be a mom. I was the first-born in a family of three and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve always fit into that stereotypical &amp;ldquo;first-born&amp;rdquo; mold. I always liked to be in-charge, set the rules, and have a certain amount of control of what was around me. Boy did that change when I became a mom! My son, Miles, was born in 2015 on Star Wars Day (if you knew how much my husband is into &amp;ldquo;Nerd Culture&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;d understand what a big deal this is).</description>
