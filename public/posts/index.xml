      <description>I remember the day my son Miles was born. It was in May. I had just spent the last 15 hours in labor. Long story short, it was a complicated birth. It was almost the universe’s way of telling us that we were in for a real adventure with our son. Since the day he was born, Miles has had a very bold personality! Ben and I always knew it just wouldn’t be fair to keep him an only child.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to be a mom. I was the first-born in a family of three and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve always fit into that stereotypical &amp;ldquo;first-born&amp;rdquo; mold. I always liked to be in-charge, set the rules, and have a certain amount of control of what was around me. Boy did that change when I became a mom! My son, Miles, was born in 2015 on Star Wars Day (if you knew how much my husband is into &amp;ldquo;Nerd Culture&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;d understand what a big deal this is).</description>
